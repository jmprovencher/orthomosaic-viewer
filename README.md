## Getting Started

* Add your Google Maps API KEY in the orthoViewer.html in the google maps javascript script.
* Open orthoViewer.html in your browser

## Generating Tiles

* Tiles are generated using [gdal2tiles](http://www.gdal.org/gdal2tiles.html)
* After generating tiles from your orthomosaic, simply replace your mapBounds in the orthoViewer.html file with your new coordinates. New map bounds can be found in the tilemapresource.xml file generated by gdal2tiles.
* You will also need to replace the path to your tiles folder
